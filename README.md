Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Description
A simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer. The game loops until you decide to quit, showing results after each round.

How to Use
Run the script.

Enter your choice: "rock", "paper", or "scissors" exactly.

The computer randomly picks its choice.

The script displays who won or if it’s a tie.

You’ll be asked if you want to play again (y or n).

Any input other than y stops the game with a goodbye message.
